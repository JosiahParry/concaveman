concaveman
----------

A very fast 2D concave hull algorithm [in JavaScript by Vladimir Agafonkin](https://github.com/mapbox/concaveman), wrapped in R (generates a general outline of a point set).

### Installation

For now, `concaveman` can only be installed from github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("joelgombin/concaveman")
```

### Usage

``` r
data(points)
points$k <- as.factor(points$k)
polygons <- concaveman(points, by = k)
```

    ## Warning in st_sf(x, ..., agr = agr): more than one geometry column: taking
    ## `polygons'; use `sf_column_name=' to specify a different column.

``` r
polygons
```

    ## Simple feature collection with 10 features and 1 field

Signature: `concaveman(points, by = NULL, concavity = 2, lengthThreshold = 0)`

-   `points` is an `sf` object.
-   `by` is the (unquoted, tidyverse-style) name of the variable defining the subsets of points for which concave hull polygons should be computed. If `NULL` (the default), only one polygon is computed for the whole set of points.
-   `concavity` is a relative measure of concavity. 1 results in a relatively detailed shape, Infinity results in a convex hull. You can use values lower than 1, but they can produce pretty crazy shapes.
-   `length_threshold`: when a segment length is under this threshold, it stops being considered for further detalization. Higher values result in simpler shapes.

### Algorithm

The algorithm is based on ideas from the paper [A New Concave Hull Algorithm and Concaveness Measure for n-dimensional Datasets, 2012](http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/page/jise/2012/201205_10.pdf) by Jin-Seo Park and Se-Jong Oh.

This implementation by Vladimir Agafonkin dramatically improves performance over the one stated in the paper (`O(rn)`, where `r` is a number of output points, to `O(n log n)`) by introducing a fast *k nearest points to a segment* algorithm, a modification of a depth-first kNN R-tree search using a priority queue.
